scripts:
========
1-script01_load_XLSX_File
    %1- load data from file 'train_bodies.xlsx' 
    %2- create docterm and dictionary
    %3- calculate tfidf of docterm
2- script02_save_Docterm_dictionary_tfidf
  % requirement: need script[1] or all matrices of docterm dic tfidf

3- script03_svd
   % requirement  = docterm OR tfidf docterm and dictionary and index
   % save results in svd_news.mat and svd_news_tfidf.mat  
4- script04_nmf
   % requirement  = docterm OR tfidf docterm and dictionary and index
   % save results in nmf_news.mat and nmf_news_tfidf.mat  


CREATING DOCTERM (no bug)
=================================
function location: createDocterm.m
script test: test_createDoctermFunction
note: 2 args newsBody and debug_message[true/false] {optional}
example : [docterm,dictionary] = createDocterm(body);

TFIDF (no bug)
========
function location = LSA.m
script test = testFolder/test_tfidf.m
example :

doctermX = [1,1,2,1,0,0,0;1,1,0,0,2,3,0];
doctermX = doctermX';
disp(doctermX);
2 ways : 
       I)  tfidf = LSA.tfidf(docterm)% default - both tf and idf are log10 based
       II) tfidf = LSA.tfidf_rationTF(docterm) - tf is ratio based and idf is log10based
